  <p>But did Carver invent peanut butter?
    <br> No. Contrary to popular belief, Carver only developed a version of peanut butter.
    <br> It was the Incas, perhaps as long ago as 950 BC, who first developed a paste from ground peanuts.
    <br> Yet, he was one of the greatest inventors in American history, discovering over 300 hundred uses for peanuts
    including chili sauce, shampoo, shaving cream and glue.
